		You're about to initialize a Firebase project in this directory:

		  C:\src\portfolio\pmose-portfolio

		Before we get started, keep in mind:

		  * You are currently outside your home directory

		? Are you ready to proceed? Yes
		? Which Firebase CLI features do you want to set up for this folder? Press Space to select features, then Enter to confirm your choices. Hosting: Configure and deploy Firebase Hosting sites

		=== Project Setup

		First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
		You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add,
		but for now we'll just set up a default project.

		? Please select an option: Use an existing project
		? Select a default Firebase project for this directory: portfolio-2e7c5 (Portfolio)
		i  Using project portfolio-2e7c5 (Portfolio)

		=== Hosting Setup

		Your public directory is the folder (relative to your project directory) that
		will contain Hosting assets to be uploaded with firebase deploy. If you
		have a build process for your assets, use your build's output directory.

		? What do you want to use as your public directory? build
		? Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? Yes
		? Set up automatic builds and deploys with GitHub? No
		? File build/index.html already exists. Overwrite? No
		i  Skipping write of build/index.html

		i  Writing configuration info to firebase.json...
		i  Writing project information to .firebaserc...

		+  Firebase initialization complete!
